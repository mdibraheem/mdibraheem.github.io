Aside from some static websites, the first lines of production code I ever wrote were in WinForms. It was an unplanned start to my development carrier as I was not working in a dev role at the time. After that, I briefly worked with WPF and ASP.NET MVC. I used Entity Framework and MS SQL Server and worked in Visual Studio. These were all fine technologies and I learned much from them. I was especially thrilled when I migrated from using raw SQL queries and datasets to Entity Framework (ORM).

Yet at the same time, I felt like spending more time trying to navigate the Microsoft eco-system than actual problem-solving. When I saw a youtube tutorial on setting up a Ruby on Rails app, I was naturally hooked. It resonated with me.

It has been more than 6 months now, and I have been fiddling around with it. The thing I love the most is the language. It is slick and so fun to write. It is the most fun I ever had writing code. And the second thing I love the most is gems. a ruby gem is like a library that you can include to give you its functionality in your project. There is a gem for practically anything you can think of.

It has been fun to play around with Ruby and Rails. And I hope to use it in a project soon.
